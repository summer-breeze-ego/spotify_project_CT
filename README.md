# How to run the program
There are two main ways to run the program using the main.py file and the presentation one.

## 0. Before everything
If there is no text database file called something like "users_database.txt", first run the function 'init_db(filename, users_dict)' where filename is the name of the database and users_dict is a dictionary of usernames as keys and playlists as dictionaries.
You can either uncomment the line in the main.py file the first time you run it or straight up just do another python file, import the function and run it.

! in certain files (i.e., constants or week2) you might have to comment or change the os.chdir value. 

## 1. main.py
Using main.py it becomes a bit of a game. If you run it you can choose from multiple choices what to do at different steps, like creating a user, running one of the discover weekly algorithms on an existing one and seeing the meaning behind the name of the project.

## 2. presentation.py
Using presentation.py you can run one of the 3 discover weekly algorithms or just print all the default algorithms.
