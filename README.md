# How to run the program
There are two main ways to run the program using the main.py file and the presentation one.

## main.py
Using main.py it becomes a bit of a game. If you run it you can choose from multiple choices what to do at different steps, like creating a user, running one of the discover weekly algorithms on an existing one and seeing the meaning behind the name of the project.

## presentation.py
Using presentation.py you can run one of the 3 discover weekly algorithms or just print all the default algorithms.
